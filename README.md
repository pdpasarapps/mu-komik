## mu-komik

mu-komik is being rebuilt around Next.js, Supabase Auth/Postgres, and Cloudflare R2. The current screen is the reader discovery shell; backend features are added against the schema in `supabase/schema.sql`.

For existing Supabase projects, run `supabase/comic-contributors.sql` once before editing comic contributor details.
For comic publishing and admin curation, run `supabase/comic-curation.sql` once on existing Supabase projects.
For the admin dashboard, run `supabase/creator-request.sql` first, then `supabase/admin-management.sql` to grant admin access to profile management.
For comic-level bookmarks on an existing database, run `supabase/comic-bookmarks.sql` once.
For static comic share previews on an existing database, run `supabase/comic-share-previews.sql` once before deploying. Admins can then generate previews for published comics from `/admin/share-previews`; new covers create their share preview in the browser and upload it directly to R2.
For admin reading analytics on an existing database, run `supabase/comic-analytics.sql` once in the Supabase SQL Editor after `supabase/creator-request.sql`, then configure `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` as a server-only secret in the production Worker and `.env.local`. The analytics route needs it to record anonymous views; never expose it in client-side code. Counts start after this migration is installed. A browser opening the same episode is counted at most once per 30-minute interval; unique readers use a random first-party cookie, not an IP address or user-agent.

## Getting Started

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the values from Supabase and Cloudflare R2. Keep `.env.local` private and never commit it. Rotate any server credentials that have been shared outside your trusted environment.

Then run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Before deploying, run `npm run build` to verify the production build locally.

For direct browser uploads and share-preview generation from R2, apply `r2-cors.json` in Cloudflare R2 bucket `mu-komik-assets` under Settings -> CORS policy. Add the final frontend domain to `AllowedOrigins` before production deployment.
Comic cover file sharing fetches images through the same-origin `/api/share-cover` route, so it does not depend on browser CORS access to the R2 public host.

For production uploads, configure these variables for the deployed Cloudflare Worker and redeploy:

- `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` and `R2_BUCKET_NAME`
- `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (store these as secrets)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

The local `.env.local` file does not configure the production Worker.

For search indexing, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to the canonical public origin (`https://mu-komik.com`) in both local and production environments. The app exposes `robots.txt` and a sitemap containing published comics and episodes; submit `https://mu-komik.com/sitemap.xml` to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools after deployment.

The Facebook App ID is configured in the global metadata and is emitted as the `fb:app_id` tag.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
